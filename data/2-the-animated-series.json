      "Overview": "This is the further adventures of the Star Trek series in a half-hour animated form. This show basically continues the adventures of the original series (presumably in the fourth year of the five-year mission), but takes advantage of the unlimited special effects provided by animation to introduce more alien crewmen (the felinoid M'Ress and the tripedal Arex) as well as introduce more elaborate adventures like an underwater adventure, the miniaturization of the crew to 1 cm., and the appearance of a giant fire-breathing two-headed dragon. The show is currently not considered \"canon\" by Paramount and the folks associated with the various subsequent TV shows. However, elements of the animated series have been used in subsequent shows (Sarek refers to the events of \"Yesteryear\" in TNG's \"Reunification Pt. 1\") and the Enterprise-D's holodeck seems to have been in part inspired by the holodeck we see in \"Practical Joker\". Also, writers such as Peter David have used some elements from t",

Neither Spock nor anyone else who were on the planet have a memory of the Andorian, while no one on the Enterprise remembers Spock! Computer records indicate Spock died as a youngster during a Vulcan ritual, and that they were scanning the Guardian when it was \"\"running\"\" that period of time. Since Spock didn't go through to save himself, he altered the timeline. The Guardian sends Spock through where he pretends to be a distant cousin. He meets Amanda and Sarek and an embittered young Spock. Young Spock eventually tries to undertake the desert ritual on his own and is almost killed. His pet sehlat saves him at the cost of its own life before Old Spock can show up. The timeline restored, everything is put back to normal.",

Uhura and Chapel are forced to take command when the male crew onboard starting acting enraptured. On the planet's surface, Kirk, Spock, McCoy, and a redshirt are first greeted than captured by the women and given headsets that suck out their energies and cause their bodies to deteriorate as if they were aging. They escape but in their enfeebled condition are trapped in a giant urn filling with rainwater. Uhura leads a landing party that defeat the women readily and find the men. The women's physiology and life-energy requirements are keyed to the planet, and Enterprise agrees to take them to a normal planet. Using the transporter and the original patterns, they restore Kirk and the others.",

Neither Jones or the Klingons, led by Kirk's \"\"old friend\"\" Captain Koloth, will say why they want him dead. It turns out Jones escaped his sentence on Station K-7 (to clean up every tribble) by finding a tribble predator called a glommer. The Klingons attack the robot ships to stop the shipment and reveal their new weapon: an energy innervator that leaves both ships powerless. Meanwhile, McCoy checks out Jones' tribbles and finds out that the tribbles are safe...sort of. They don't reproduce. They just get bigger...and bigger. When Kirk beams the giant-sized tribbles aboard the Klingon ship, Koloth reveals a state secret: they created the glommer and want it back from Cyrano, who \"\"acquired\"\" it. Kirk obliges but at",

Keniclius plans to clone Spock as he cloned himself (being the \"\"fifth\"\" generation of the original) and bring peace to the galaxy via conquest.

They came to Earth and practiced magic, but were hated, feared, and driven out. They put the Enterprise crew on trial in a mock Salem but it is actually Lucien they consider at fault. They agree to let the Enterprise go but condemn Lucien to eternal imprisonment. Defending Lucien, Kirk challenges the court ruling and uses magic himself to fend off the Chief Prosecutor.

The planet is plagued with volcanic activity and has a radiation that when focused causes organic shrinkage. Kirk finds a miniature city just before being beamed back up on automatic. He finds the ship deserted: the city below beamed the Enterprise crew, now at their same size down.

They and the lead ship commanded by Captain Kor disappear and reappear in a mysterious null area of space filled with abandoned ships. They find a concentrated population on one ship and both captains are whisked away to meet with a Council of various aliens who are trapped there. Unable to escape because of the eventual drain of all higher power systems, they have formed a peaceful coalition, the Elysians, and insist the newcomers obey their rules.

        "Overview": "While carrying an ancient Slaver stasis box to a star base, Spock, Uhura, and Sulu get an indication that there is another nearby. Upon investigating, they are taken prisoner by the Kzinti - a cat-like race who hate humans after losing several wars to them. The Kzinti have an empty Slaver box, which is the only way to find another stasis box. They manage to open the Enterprise crew's box and find old meat, a strange hologram statue, and...a mysterious gun-like device. The item can shift its form. Spock and Sulu manage to escape but are recaptured when they trigger a matter-destruct sequence. An energy-draining setting almost lets Uhura escape. The Kzinti eventually stumble upon a setting that activates a sentient computer. When they are unable to provide the proper passwords it nonetheless provides them with another setting when they request the matter conversion form. But it's a self-destruct setting: the computer believes the Kzinti to be Slaver enemies and gives them the means to th",

        "Overview": "The Enterprise crew go looking for the missing Ariel, a science ship. They track it to a class M planet. Kirk, Spock, and McCoy beam down and after passing through a series of oddly divided ecological regions, are captured by strange slug-like creatures. They are taken to a high-tech zoo where they meet the remaining three survivors of the Ariel. They are exhibits in the zoo belonging to the Lactran slug-aliens, who are highly intelligent. The creatures are so intelligent they don't recognize the humans and Spock as intelligent. One of the Ariel crewman is dying of an illness, and uniting their mental force with Spock they manage to contact a Lactran child to give them the medical kit and a communicator. The child snatches the communicator just as Scotty beams it up. While the adults concentrate their mental powers on Kirk in an effort to recover their child, almost driving him mad, the Lactran child takes over the Enterprise. After scanning its computers it beams back with Scotty and",

He is rude and obnoxious and dangerously independent, but Kirk is under orders to treat him well to further relations with Pandro. After six months in his cabin Bem insists on going on a landing party. Trying to rescue Bem (who claims he is observing the primitive locals), Kirk and Spock are captured. Bem has replaced their communicators and phasers with dummies to observe them under stress as well. He reveals he is a colony creature who can split his body into separate, individually independent parts. Meanwhile, a sensory anomaly is sweeping over the planet, and appears to be a \"\"god\"\" of some sort that claims responsibility over its \"\"children\"\" and insists they leave. Bem escapes and Kirk rescues him again by telling the \"\"god\"\" that he has the same responsibility to Bem it does to her children. A chastened Bem acquiesces and the planet's natives are left to develop",

It replicates Kirk's shirts with \"\"Kirk is a Jerk\"\" on the back, manufacturers devices that leave a black eye ring on Spock, and shoot cream pies out of the food devices. Things take a turn for the worse when McCoy, Sulu, and Uhura are trapped in thea holodeck where they are beset by dangerous weather phenomena. They are rescued by Scotty when he bypasses the controls, but the Enterprise crew are further endangered when the Romulans attack and the ship's computer overrides manual controls. By feigning fear of the cloud, Kirk tricks the ship's computer into entering the cloud, which reverses the process. As they depart, they pick up transmissions from the pursuing Romulan ship that they are experiencing strange phenomena from their computer...",

They are attacked by a serpent-shaped energy field belonging to a feathered serpent who claims to be Kulkukan of Mayan-Aztec legend. It beams Kirk, McCoy, Scott, and Ensign Walking Bear aboard its ship to solve its puzzle before he will reveal himself. Aligning the mirrors in a strange city, they solve the puzzle and Kulkukan appears before them. It takes them to its \"\"zoo\"\" of violent creatures that now live in tranquility. Spock figures a way to break Kulkukan's force field and Kirk uses the diversion to free the animals. Kulkukan realizes that is not a god, but just a delusional old alien that once helped the younger races along. It leaves in sadness, leaving McCoy to remember the Shakespearean quote, \"\"How sharper than a serpent's tooth is an ungrateful child...\"\"",
