                "Overview": "The Enterprise makes a rendezvous with the S.S. Antares and picks up a 17 year old boy, Charlie Evans who is the only survivor of a colony expedition that crashed on the planet Thasus. Captain Ramart and his staff rave about the boy, but Kirk can’t help but be puzzled when Ramart refuses luxury items and hurries back to the Antares. Charlie, without social skills of any measure, seems a bit strange and unrefined but states that he grew up alone with only the record tapes from the wreckage for company. Sometime later, Captain Ramart signals the Enterprise and tries to warn Kirk about something, but just then the Antares is destroyed. Kirk doesn’t think much about Charlie’s disinterested reaction to the deaths of his former friends, but Spock begins to suspect that there is more to the boy than they know. This is confirmed when Charlie makes a crewman disappear for laughing at him while in the gym. During this time, Charlie becomes infatuated with the first ^girl^ he saw after coming aboard the Enterprise, Yeoman Rand. Unable to control his desires, Charlie pesters Rand until she is forced to hurt him, first by rejecting the boy and then by slapping him while in her quarters. This, of course, causes Charlie to make her disappear as well. Now realizing the full extent of Charlie’s powers and the danger he could pose to civilization, Kirk tries to alter the ship’s course away from their next stop, Colony 5, but Charlie learns of his plans, seizes control of the Enterprise, and locks in a course for Colony 5. By this time the Thasians, noncorporeal beings who really raised Charlie and gave him his powers, discover that the boy is missing and intercept the Enterprise. Despite Charlie’s pleas not to be taken away, the Thasians remove Charlie from the Enterprise and restore the crew back to normal.",

Kirk, Spock, and McCoy beam down to the planet to investigate and find a ragged group of fugitive slaves trying to stay hidden from the police. These “sun worshippers” distrust the landing party but soon discover that they are not a threat. Kirk informs them that he is looking for another group of strangers led by a man named Merik. Merikus is the First Citizen of the Empire, but Kirk is not sure if it is the same man. Pursuaded to help them find Merik and his crew, the leader of the fugitives sends Flavius, an ex-gladiator, to be their guide. The landing party, however, is soon captured and led into the city where they discover a civilization much like 20th century Earth, but culturally similar to ancient Rome. The landing party find Merik, now First Citizen Merikus, who six years ago abandoned his ship and beamed his crew down to the planet. Those who could adapt survived, and th",

While in orbit, the ship intercepts a transporter beam from an unknown part of the galaxy and beams the space traveler aboard. Surprised by what has taken place, the man identifies himself as Gary Seven and claims to be a 20th Century Earthman raised on an unknown world and trained to prevent Earth from destroying itself. Kirk decides to verify Seven’s story before releasing him, but Seven escapes and beams down to the planet below. Kirk and Spock follow him to New York City, and Seven meanwhile discovers that two of his fellow agents have been killed in a auto accident. Seven is forced to complete their mission himself which is to sabotage an orbital nuclear platform, just low enough in the atmosphere to scare Earth leaders into prohibiting additional nuclear space weapons. Just as Kirk and Spock arrive, Seven beams out of his office a",

After Spock’s body is fitted with a device that allows McCoy to control the Vulcan’s motor functions with a remote control, Kirk starts a search for Spock’s brain, hoping it can be recovered and somehow returned to Spock before his body decays.",

Kirk finds that the monolith can be opened by the combination of sounds found in the order “Kirk to Enterprise,” but when he enters the obelisk, he is attacked by waves of energy that erase his mind. With no time to spare, Spock and McCoy have to return to the Enterprise without Kirk, and begin trying to use the ship’s tractor beam to divert the asteroid. Meanwhile, Kirk becomes the tribal chief, takes a wife and even expects to become a father, but the Enterprise may not be able to save her former captain’s future.",

This show basically continues the adventures of the original series (presumably in the fourth year of the five-year mission), but takes advantage of the unlimited special effects provided by animation to introduce more alien crewmen (the felinoid M'Ress and the tripedal Arex) as well as introduce more elaborate adventures like an underwater adventure, the miniaturization of the crew to 1 cm., and the appearance of a giant fire-breathing two-headed dragon. The show is currently not considered \"canon\" by Paramount and the folks associated with the various subsequent TV shows. However, elements of the animated series have been used in subsequent shows (Sarek refers to the events of \"Yesteryear\" in TNG’s \"Reunification Pt. 1\") and the Enterprise-D’s holodeck seems to have been in part inspired by the holodeck we see in \"Practical Joker\". Also, writers such as Peter David have used some elements from t",

Neither Spock nor anyone else who were on the planet have a memory of the Andorian, while no one on the Enterprise remembers Spock! Computer records indicate Spock died as a youngster during a Vulcan ritual, and that they were scanning the Guardian when it was “running” that period of time. Since Spock didn’t go through to save himself, he altered the timeline. The Guardian sends Spock through where he pretends to be a distant cousin. He meets Amanda and Sarek and an embittered young Spock. Young Spock eventually tries to undertake the desert ritual on his own and is almost killed. His pet sehlat saves him at the cost of its own life before Old Spock can show up. The timeline restored, everything is put back to normal.",

Neither Jones or the Klingons, led by Kirk’s “old friend” Captain Koloth, will say why they want him dead.

Meanwhile, McCoy checks out Jones’ tribbles and finds out that the tribbles are safe...sort of. They don’t reproduce. They just get bigger...and bigger.

Keniclius plans to clone Spock as he cloned himself (being the “fifth” generation of the original) and bring peace to the galaxy via conquest.

McCoy whips up some weedkiller and the Enterprise landing party get past the Phylosians only to confront a giant Spock; Keniclius’ first of many. But the original is to be sacrificed. Kirk goads the giant Spock into assisting the younger one by drawing on its reflexive actions. The clone-Spock revives the original with a mind meld and Keniclius gives up his dreams of conquest.

They are rescued from total system collapse and death by a satyrlike creature named Lucien. He claims to be happy to have them finally come visiting, but preaches caution. Spock deduces that magic actually works in this universe, but the Enterprise crew’s experimental use of it attracts the attention of Lucien’s people. They came to Earth and practiced magic, but were hated, feared, and driven out. They put the Enterprise crew on trial in a mock Salem but it is actually Lucien they consider at fault. They agree to let the Enterprise go but condemn Lucien to eternal imprisonment. Defending Lucien, Kirk challenges the court ruling and uses magic himself to fend off the Chief Prosecutor. Impressed by Kirk’s willingness to die for Lucien, who may have been the inspiration for Lucifer, the Megans send the En",

Spock and Kirk pursue him to an abandoned planet but not before the potion is distributed into the air system. The potion has a delayed effect and Spock soon becomes enarmored of Christine. Complicating matters, a giant rock creature on the planet attacks and the Enterprise crew are too romantically distracted to rescue them. Kirk manages to use the love potion on the Godzilla-sized creature and it spares them long enough to be rescued. The potion’s effects totally reverse and the love-smitten duos hate each other for an equal period of time.

They track it to the single planet orbiting the supernova and are hit with a burst of light from the volcanic planet. The crew and all organic matter begin to shrink while the ship’s circuits are fused and the dilithium burned out. Struggling against a ship that they will soon be unable to control, they beam Kirk down to the signal source. The transporter recreates him from the original pattern, restoring him to normal size. The planet is plagued with volcanic activity and has a radiation that when focused causes organic shrinkage. Kirk finds a miniature city just before being beamed back up on automatic. He finds the ship deserted: the city below beamed the Enterprise crew, now at their same size down. The “shrink attack” was the only way they had to contact Enterprise, and they are about to be destroyed by volcanic activity. They were a lost colony: Terra 10 (i.e., “terr",

They find a concentrated population on one ship and both captains are whisked away to meet with a Council of various aliens who are trapped there. Unable to escape because of the eventual drain of all higher power systems, they have formed a peaceful coalition, the Elysians, and insist the newcomers obey their rules. The Klingons fail in one attempt to escape the area, but Spock determines that the two ships together might succeed if they operate in tandem. Reluctantly Kor agrees but prepares to sabotage efforts. He has his mate plant a bomb during a social party between the two crews.

Upon investigating, they are taken prisoner by the Kzinti—a cat-like race who hate humans after losing several wars to them. The Kzinti have an empty Slaver box, which is the only way to find another stasis box. They manage to open the Enterprise crew’s box and find old meat, a strange hologram statue, and...a mysterious gun-like device. The item can shift its form. Spock and Sulu manage to escape but are recaptured when they trigger a matter-destruct sequence. An energy-draining setting almost lets Uhura escape. The Kzinti eventually stumble upon a setting that activates a sentient computer. When they are unable to provide the proper passwords it nonetheless provides them with another setting when they request the matter conversion form.

He convinces a reluctant Worf to accompany the group into Klingon territory, and then travels to the past, where he orders the crew into the Devron system. Finally, he returns to the present, where he is able to get Tomalak, the Romulan Commander on the other side of the border, to agree to entering the Neutral Zone together. Now heading for the anomaly in all three time periods, Picard learns that it exists in the present, and is larger in the past, but does not exist in the future.",
